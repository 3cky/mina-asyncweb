<h1>The AsyncHttpClient is a high performance HTTP client API that is based on the Java NIO networking API.</h1>
This API is based on the <a href="http://mina.apache.org">Apache MINA</a> framework to provide a high
performance networking library based on the HTTP protocol. The AsyncHttpClient utilizes the Java NIO and
mutlithreaded capabilities to be able to handle many concurrent outbound connections without having threads
sitting in a wait state. There are numerous applications this API can be good for, such as gaming applications
or web servers that need to access 3rd party web components and operate under heavy load. The major
implication for this API is the ability to effectively and efficiently make use of threads while waiting for
responses from the server.
